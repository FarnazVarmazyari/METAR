# MAGIC ### Summary of handling potential outliers:
# MAGIC There are obseravations in our data set have a value that is either lower or higher than the national record and therefore, these values will be removed from our study since they are potentially outliers:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC | Variable name   | Min Value   | Max Value  |
# MAGIC |:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
# MAGIC | `tmpf` |0|-|
# MAGIC |`dwpf`  |-23|96|
# MAGIC |`sknt`  |-| 220|
# MAGIC | `alti`| 25 |32|
# MAGIC |`vsby`|-|40|
# MAGIC |`relh`|-|110%|
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Extra Notes:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - 14 `tmpf` observations were removed from the data set
# MAGIC - As per records, the lowest dew point ever recorded was in Las Vegas and it was -22 F
# MAGIC - 21 `sknt` observations were removed from the data set
# MAGIC - 11 `alti` observations were removed from the data set. Alaska has the highest recorded pressure reading of 31.85" -  January 31, 1989 at Northway during one of the stateâ€™s greatest cold waves, Matecumbe Key, Florida has the lowest recorded pressure of 26.34" - September 2, 1935 (The Great Labor Day Hurricane)
# MAGIC - 53 `relh` observations were removed from the data set

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##### `valid`:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC   - The data set consists of METAR readings recorded from August 01, 2012 to September 01, 2012

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##### `drct` represents the direction that the wind is blowing from
# MAGIC  - 0 degrees represents north
# MAGIC  - 90 degrees represents east
# MAGIC  - 180 degrees represents south
# MAGIC  - 270 degrees represents west
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 55,494 observations in `drct` have the value of 360. These values were changed to 0 since 0 and 360 degrees essentially represent the same thing.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##### Sky variables
# MAGIC `skyl1`, `skyl2`, `skyl3` and `skyl4` represent the height at which the sky condition was recorded and the corresponding sky condition is represented by `skyc1`, `skyc2`, `skyc3` and `skyc4`
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - The sky condition (`skyc1`, `skyc2`, `skyc3` and `skyc4`) can have the following values: 
# MAGIC   - FEW (1/8 TO 2/8 cloud coverage), 
# MAGIC   - SCT (SCATTERED, 3/8 TO 4/8 cloud coverage, 
# MAGIC   - BKN (5/8-7/8 coverage), or 
# MAGIC   - OVC (OVERCAST, 8/8 Coverage)
# MAGIC   - An indefinite ceiling caused by fog, rain, snow, etc., will have a designator as **VV (Vertical Visibility)**
# MAGIC   - CLR
# MAGIC      
# MAGIC - Every `skyl` value should have a corresponding `skyc` value
# MAGIC   - 5 observations have a value for the sky condition but do not have a corresponding sky altitude level and these observations will be eliminated from the study
# MAGIC - `skyl1`, `skyl2`, `skyl3` and `skyl4` should have values such that `skyl1 < skyl2 <skyl3 < skyl4` 
# MAGIC   - 29 observations do not follow the assumed trend of `skyl1 < skyl2 <skyl3 < skyl4` and these observations will be eliminated from the study

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Weather groups are usually constructed by considering columns 1 to 5 in sequence, i.e. intensity, followed by description, followed by weather phenomena
# MAGIC   - e.g. heavy rain shower(s) is coded as +SHRA
# MAGIC   - Tornados and waterspouts are coded as +FC
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - `presentwx` is recorded as BR (mist) or HZ (haze) when the `p0li` is `null`
# MAGIC - It is possible to observe more than one intensity, obscuration and precipitation at a time 
# MAGIC   - (Example: -RASN BR represents rain and snow at the same time)
# MAGIC - There are 255 distinct values in the `presentwx` column
